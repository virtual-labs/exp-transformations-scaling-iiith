      "question": "1. What does scaling transformation in computer graphics primarily involve?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Rotation of objects.",
        "b": "Changing the shape of objects.",
        "c": "Altering the position of objects.",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Rotation is a different transformation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Changing shape is associated with deformation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Translation involves altering position.",
        "d": "Correct! Scaling transformation primarily adjusts the size of objects."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This describes uniform scaling.",
        "b": "Correct! Non-uniform scaling involves different factors along each axis.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Negative factors may involve reflection but not non-uniform scaling.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rotation is a separate transformation."
