      "question": "1. What does scaling transformation in computer graphics primarily involve?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Rotation of objects.",
        "b": "Changing the shape of objects.",
        "c": "Altering the position of objects.",
        "d": "Adjusting the size of objects."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Rotation is a different transformation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Changing shape is associated with deformation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Translation involves altering position.",
        "d": "Correct! Scaling transformation primarily adjusts the size of objects."

      "question": "2. Which matrix represents a uniform scaling transformation in 2D?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "[[s, 0], [0, s]]",

        "a": "Incorrect. Incorrect order of scaling factors.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Addition is not used for scaling.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Division is not used for scaling.",
        "d": "Correct! The formula is (x * Sx, y * Sy) for 2D scaling."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This describes uniform scaling.",
        "b": "Correct! Non-uniform scaling involves different factors along each axis.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Negative factors may involve reflection but not non-uniform scaling.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rotation is a separate transformation."

    {
      "question": "5. What is the main advantage of using matrix representation for scaling transformations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Matrix representation is more efficient for translation.",
