# Procedure

## Step 1: Understanding Controls and Features
- Familiarize yourself with the mouse and touch controls listed under **Mouse Controls** and **Mobile Touch Controls**. Understand how left-click, right-click, scrolling, and touch gestures translate, rotate, and zoom the simulation.
- Learn about locking options such as **Lock Graph**, **Lock Zoom**, and **Lock Rotate** to understand how they restrict specific functionalities in the simulation.

## Step 2: Shape Manipulation
- Explore the **Shape Controls** section. Practice adding, selecting, editing, and deleting shapes using the corresponding buttons (**Add**, **Edit**, **Delete**). Note the instructions regarding shape placement and the warnings about avoiding overlapping coordinates.

## Step 3: Scaling and Transformation
- Study the **Scaling Controls** section. Adjust the scaling factors for the X, Y, and Z axes using the input fields provided. Use the **Apply Scaling** button to apply these factors to the shapes in the simulation.
- Review the **Transformation Matrix** and understand its role in scaling shapes proportionally across different axes.

## Step 4: Grid Options and Visualization
- Explore the **Grid Options** section to toggle the display of XY-grid, YZ-grid, and XZ-grid using checkboxes. Understand how these grids aid in visualizing spatial relationships within the simulation.
- Experiment with the slider control to adjust scaling along the X, Y, and Z axes visually.

## Step 5: Reset and Best Practices
- Utilize the **Reset All** button located at the bottom of the scaling controls section to revert all controls and settings to their default values.
- Follow the note about ensuring the slider is at zero before making adjustments for accurate scaling.
