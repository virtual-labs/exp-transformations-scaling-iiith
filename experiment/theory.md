Scaling in 3D space involves multiplying the distances from the coordinate axes by constant factors along each axis. The scaling matrix, denoted as T<sub>scaling</sub>, scales by factors v<sup>x</sup>, v<sup>y</sup>, and v<sup>z</sup>.

The scaling matrix in 3D:

Given a vector [x, y, z], after scaling:

A scaling transformation can be interpreted as resizing the coordinate axes while keeping the points constant. For example, a scaling by (2, 3, 4) would require redrawing each unit on the X-axis as 2 units, each unit on the Y-axis as 3 units, and each unit on the Z-axis as 4 units.

This fundamental concept is integral to understanding how objects can be enlarged or reduced in 3D space through scaling transformations.
