## Experiment Procedure

1. **Introduction to Scaling Transformation:**
   - This experiment serves as an introduction to the fundamental concept of scaling transformation in computer graphics.
   - Scaling transformation involves adjusting the size of graphical objects, a crucial aspect in creating dynamic and visually appealing graphics.

2. **Interactive Point Scaling:**
   - A point is chosen as the subject for scaling transformation in this experiment.
   - Utilize the slider located at the bottom of the interface to observe the dynamic movement of the point as the scaling is applied.
   - This interactive feature allows participants to visually grasp the impact of scaling on the position of the point.

3. **Node Representation of Transformation:**
   - The experiment incorporates a visual representation of the scaling transformation through a tree structure.
   - A node within the tree corresponds to the transformation applied to the point, providing insights into the scaling values along each axis.
   - By manipulating the slider, participants can witness an animated transition between the initial and final positions of the point, enhancing their understanding of the transformation.

4. **Matrix Representation (T):**
   - The scaling matrix (T) responsible for the transformation is displayed prominently.
   - Participants can actively engage with the experiment by editing the scale values along any axis.
   - Observe how the scaling matrix dynamically adjusts in response to these modifications, reinforcing the relationship between matrix operations and scaling transformations.

5. **Understanding Coordinate System Modification:**
   - An additional layer of comprehension is introduced by interpreting transformations as modifications to the coordinate system while preserving the point's original position.
   - Explore this concept by checking the "Transform Coordinate Systems" checkbox located under the Display tab.
   - This feature facilitates a comparison between the standard transformation and the modified coordinate system, providing a nuanced understanding of how transformations can be interpreted in different contexts.

By following these steps, participants will not only gain practical experience in applying scaling transformations but also develop a deeper understanding of the associated matrix operations and the nuances of interpreting transformations in different coordinate systems.
