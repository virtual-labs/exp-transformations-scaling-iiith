          "a": "Objects become smaller.",
          "b": "Objects maintain their size.",
          "c": "Objects become larger.",

        "explanations": {
          "a": "Incorrect. Objects become larger when the scaling factor is greater than 1.",
          "b": "Incorrect. Objects actually change size.",
          "c": "Correct! Objects become larger when the scaling factor is greater than 1.",

        "answers": {
          "a": "It flips the object.",

        "correctAnswer": "a",
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Correct! Negative scaling factors cause the object to flip.",
          "b": "Incorrect. Negative scaling doesn't cause uniform shrinking.",
          "c": "Incorrect. Negative scaling doesn't cause uniform enlargement.",

        "explanations": {
          "a": "Incorrect. The fixed point is influenced by scaling.",
          "b": "Correct! The fixed point is the center of scaling operations.",
          "c": "Incorrect. The scaling factor is independent of the fixed point.",
